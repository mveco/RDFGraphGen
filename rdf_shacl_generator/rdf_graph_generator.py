Function Explanation:
---------------------
The 'dictionary_to_rdf_graph' function generates RDF triples based on the specified constraints of a SHACL shape
represented as a dictionary.

Parameters:
-----------
shape_dictionary (dict): A dictionary representing a SHACL shape with constraints and properties.
shape_name (str): Name of the SHACL shape.
result (rdflib.Graph): RDF graph to which the generated triples will be added.
parent (rdflib.BNode or None): Parent node in the RDF graph to which the generated triples will be attached.
dictionary (dict): Dictionary containing other SHACL shapes for reference.
property_pair_constraint_components_parent (list): List of property pair constraint components.
parent_class (rdflib.URIRef): URIRef representing the parent class of the SHACL shape.

Returns:
--------
rdflib.BNode or rdflib.URIRef: The RDF node representing the SHACL shape in the generated graph.

"""
    Function Explanation:
    ---------------------
    The 'generate_rdf_graph' function generates RDF graphs by processing SHACL shapes from the provided shapes_graph.
    For each independent node shape, it generates the specified number of RDF samples using the 'dictionary_to_rdf_graph'
    function.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    shapes_graph (rdflib.Graph): The RDF Shapes graph containing SHACL shapes and related information.
    dictionary (dict): Dictionary of SHACL shapes.
    number_of_samples (int): The number of RDF samples to generate for each independent node shape.

    Returns:
    --------
    rdflib.Graph: The resulting RDF graph containing generated samples based on SHACL shapes.

    Explanation:
    ------------
    - The function initializes an empty RDF graph ('result_graph') to store the generated triples.
    - It identifies independent node shapes using the 'find_independent_node_shapes' function.
    - For each independent node shape, it iteratively calls the 'dictionary_to_rdf_graph' function to generate
      RDF samples and adds them to 'result_graph'.
    - Finally, it returns the resulting RDF graph containing the generated samples.

    Note: The 'dictionary_to_rdf_graph' function is responsible for generating RDF triples based on SHACL constraints.

    Function Explanation:
    ---------------------
    The 'generate_rdf_graphs_from_shacl_constraints' function streamlines the process of generating RDF graphs based on
    SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) constraints specified in a given file. It parses the SHACL shapes from the input
    file, converts them into a dictionary representation, and utilizes this dictionary to create RDF graphs conforming to
    the specified constraints.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    shape_file (str): The path to the file containing SHACL shapes.
    number (int): The number of RDF graphs to generate.

    Returns:
    --------
    rdflib.Graph: The resulting RDF graph conforming to the SHACL constraints.

    Explanation:
    ------------
    - The function begins by creating an empty RDF graph ('shape') using the 'rdflib' library and parses the SHACL
      shapes from the given file into this graph.
    - It then calls the helper function 'generate_dictionary_from_shapes_graph' to convert the parsed SHACL shapes
      graph into a dictionary representation. This dictionary encompasses the properties and constraints specified
      in SHACL shapes.
    - The function proceeds to invoke 'generate_rdf_graph', passing the parsed SHACL shapes graph, the generated
      dictionary, and the specified number of samples. This function creates RDF graphs conforming to the SHACL
      constraints.
    - Finally, the function returns the resulting RDF graph, providing easy access to a representation of RDF data
      structures compliant with the specified SHACL constraints.
